## üöÄ Get Value, Free!

This repo offers **hundreds of n8n workflows** (thousands of dollars in value!) for projects benefiting the community. My "Free For Community Use" (FFCU) license makes them available to you. It's about **mutual uplift** and being **more efficient when we work together!**

## ‚úÖ Do You Qualify for Free Access?

If your project is **open source** and actively maintained, you likely qualify. Even "fair use" code is cool with us. Pre-revenue projects, even closed-source or non-code based, might also qualify if they clearly benefit a community. This includes:

### ‚ú® **All Active open-source repos.**
* **Non-profits** (especially those on [CharityWatch.org's Top-Rated Charities](https://www.charitywatch.org/top-rated-charities) or genuinely distributing funds).
* **Bootstrapped, pre-revenue projects** (code or non-code) building a community.
* **Community volunteer efforts** using automation.

**The core idea:** If your project **benefits a community** and is **actively updated**, these workflows can help you automate and grow.

## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Get Free Access

To prevent abuse, access requires a quick request. This isn't "$0+," it's free *for community use*.

1.  **Check the qualifications above.**
2.  **Grab your project's URL** (GitHub repo or relevant project link).
3.  **Submit your request here:** [How to Submit Your Project for FFCU Access](https://github.com/Cfomodz/community-use/blob/main/projects.md)

We'll review it and grant access if your project fits our FFCU criteria.

## üí≤ Free as in speech, not free as in beer Non-Limiting Commercial License

If your project doesn't meet the FFCU qualifications, these workflows are available for unlimited commercial use, yes, really. The commercial license is non-restrictive. We believe in freedom, even if you have to pay for it.
